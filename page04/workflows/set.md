One-Page Brand Website Definition Prompt (English)

1. Purpose

This website is a single-page scrolling brand site for a person/team who builds websites.
It is designed to function as a business card, not as a traditional portfolio.

The goal is not to list projects, but to clearly communicate how we think, how we work, and why our approach is reliable.
	•	The visitor should quickly understand what kind of builder we are.
	•	The message is concise, but the structure is precise.
	•	Emotional persuasion is secondary to structural clarity.
	•	The website itself must demonstrate the quality of the websites we build.

	•	Startup founders, brand owners, solo creators
	•	People who value clarity, structure, and maintainability over decoration
